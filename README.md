# Neural Network Implementations

## Overview
This repository contains modular implementations of fundamental neural network architectures from scratch, including:
- **MLP** (Multilayer Perceptron)
- **CNN** (Convolutional Neural Network)
- **RNN** (Recurrent Neural Network)
- **LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory)

Each implementation includes:
- Clean, documented Python code
- Training visualization tools
- Interactive hyperparameter tuning
- Performance benchmarking
